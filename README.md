# Real World Testing with Cypress TodoMVC

This application is part of the Testing Your First Application Course in the Real World Testing with Cypress Curriculum.

I copied the app from here: <https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-todomvc>. I updated some of the packages to newer versions and I'm using `npm` as the package manager instead of `yarn`.

I'm following the cypress course here: <https://learn.cypress.io/>.
